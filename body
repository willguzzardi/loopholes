## _How can I help?_

### Tell Your Legislators to Support the Bill
1. Find out who your state representative is and how to reach them.
  * [Click here](http://www.elections.il.gov/districtlocator/addressfinder.aspx), enter your address, and click "Find Address"
  * If it found you, click "Confirm Address." Your representative's name will appear.
2. Call their office and ask for their support.
  * Dial the office number listed. Most likely, a staffer will pick up.
  * Say, "My name is (Your Name) and I'm a constituent of Rep (Their Name). I'm calling to ask them to sign on to House Bill 4004, which would close a billion dollars in corporate tax loopholes."
  * They'll thank you for the call, and that'll be it. But trust us, this stuff matters to your representatives.
3. If they've got an email address listed, send them an email too! 
  * Put "Support HB4004" in the subject line 
  * Copy and paste the above text, or write whatever you feel.
